            Earlier this year,   I wrote about our Free AWS Instructional Videos and the   associated AWS labs.The videos and the labs will help you to get started using   an AWS Service in about 30 minutes.Each Introduction to AWS topic includes a short video to help you   learn key concepts and terminology as well as see a step-by-step   console demonstration.</p>
