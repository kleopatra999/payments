<p>Spreedly has just made support for JSONP publicly available for adding payment methods.While we have had support for CORS for some time now, the addition of JSONP improves options for developers.The transparent redirect is still a great places to get started for adding payment methods with Spreedly.It is a simple form that doesn’t require any custom client side code.However your needs may be more advanced.</p>
