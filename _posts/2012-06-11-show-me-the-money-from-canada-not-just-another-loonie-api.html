<p>Based in Vancouver, BC, Payfirma has created an XML-based API that promises custom forms and full shopping carts to keep you in control of developing the flow of your credit card processing.The idea is to make business’s lives simpler by reducing development costs with the Payfirma API that accepts Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express among others.Payfirma states the API also is pre-integrated with third party shopping carts, and has a payments profiles API to keep customers on the retailer’s site while preventing the storing of card data on the retailer’s server.This eliminates online credit card risks and is supported by Visa and Mastercard Secure Code.It’s easy to see how Payforma developed in Canada.</p>
