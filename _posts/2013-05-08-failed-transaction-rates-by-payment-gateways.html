<p>Spreedly is a credit card vault in the cloud that allows you to work multiple payment gateways simultaneously or over time.As such, we’re in a unique position to see transactional data across payment gateways for our customers.Failed transactions are an ongoing concern for all of our customers.At best they equal a costly customer support intervention and at worst lost sales.So while many merchants spend time on sites like Feefighters trying to optimize rates paid others understand that failed transactions are potentially the same or more important than the fees they pay.</p>
