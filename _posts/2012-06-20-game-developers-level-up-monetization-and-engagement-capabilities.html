<p>Fierce Developer recently reported that 97 percent of all App Store revenues are earned by the top 20 percent of iOS developers and that half of all mobile games in the store produce less than $3,000 of revenue.Further still, Ilja Laurs, the founder and executive chairman of GetJar, said that 80 percent of mobile games are played only once and therefore customers will always be reluctant to pay for games.Many game developers are shifting their focus to freemium games using in-app purchases to generate revenue, which Laurs said can generate 10 to 50 times higher value than the price of a paid app.Today, Urban Airship announced a strategic partnership and integration with Roar Engine, which offers all the backend services game developers need to drive greater commercial success.Roar Engine’s highly configurable game building blocks manage player state, game logic, virtual goods and social mechanics, while the integration of Urban Airship’s high-performance push messaging service enables server-side game events to trigger push messages to drive greater gamer engagement and promote in-app purchase opportunities at the right time.</p>
