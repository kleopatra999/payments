<p>Last week we shared a series of animated films created by our friends at Wieden+Kennedy that showcase different use cases of Good Push.Today, we unveil The Pocket Guide to Good Push—a 70-page mini-booklet—to help you understand the best practices to serve mobile consumers with value-based messages that build stronger brand relationships over time.As the newest marketing communications channel, push notifications offer the opportunity to engage directly with consumers on arguably the most valuable real estate possible—smartphone home screens—which is tremendously powerful, but also something that must be recognized and treated as a privilege.Over the next several months we’ll offer you additional Good Push educational resources, and to ensure you take the time from your busy schedule to review them, we also launched the Good Push Index, which, at the highest level, discovered that push messaging can double both mobile app engagement and user retention.Whether you have one app or a dozen, you know how difficult it can be to get people to discover and download your app and this is only the beginning of the battle for screen time.</p>
