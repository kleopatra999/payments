<p>We wondered if processing speeds would be better compared to December (where gateways are under full holiday season load), but surprisingly we didnâ€™t see much change across most of the gateways we track.Oddly though, despite the increased December volumes, a number of the larger gateways actually performed better in processing speed performance over the holiday period than they did in January but also experienced the biggest month-to-month swings in success and failure rates.As always, enjoy the data and please share it amongst your contacts.Thanks again to Shopify for pooling their data with us.</p>
