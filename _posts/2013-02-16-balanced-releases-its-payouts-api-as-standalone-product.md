<p>Marketplace payment service Balanced has announced the official release of its Balanced Payouts, a standalone API that allows developers to tap into next-day ACH deposits .While not a new feature for the company, it is the first time it has been released on its own — previously it was part of the company’s full marketplace payments offering.This is the latest update from the Y Combinator alumnus, formerly known as PoundPay.Since last October, the company tells us that it has seen growth increase five-times and has seen 100,000 API calls per day.What the service does is help facilitate all the financial issues a marketplace typically needs to worry about.</p>
