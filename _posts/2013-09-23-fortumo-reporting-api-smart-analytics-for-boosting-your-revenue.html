<p>An important part of our mobile payment solution is the Fortumo Dashboard.The Dashboard provides one place to create new payment services, see an overview of revenues and real-time reports on transactions.Data from the Dashboard on which countries have the biggest number of users, how much these users are paying and when they are making purchases can be helpful when fine-tuning your app monetization strategy.To make it as easy as possible for you to access this data and integrate it with your business intelligence system, we have created the Fortumo Reporting API.With the Reporting API you can request data for a given time period containing transactions per service, revenue in preferred currency, billed and failed payments.</p>
