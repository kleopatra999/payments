<p>Ireland is the fourth country (and first Eurozone nation) in which Stripe has launched.To date, online payments infrastructure in most of these countries, including Ireland, has been dominated by lumbering incumbent banks.Accepting internet payments involved weeks of setup, reams of paperwork, and bureaucratic approval processes.We want to fix this.With Stripe’s launch in Ireland, we’re bringing all our core functionality to every Irish individual and business: instant setup, full control over the user experience, straightforward pricing, and a fully integrated stack.</p>
