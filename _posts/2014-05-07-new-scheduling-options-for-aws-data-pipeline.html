Today we are making the Data Pipeline more flexible and more useful with the addition of a new scheduling model that works at the level of an entire pipeline.This builds upon the existing model, which allows you to schedule the individual activities within a pipeline.The schedule that you set for each pipeline will be inherited by   every object in the pipeline.</p>
