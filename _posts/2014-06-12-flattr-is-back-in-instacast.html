<p>The Instacast Cloud is built to handle sync of all your Instacast devices.But it also makes it possible to automatically Flattr the podcasts you listen to.Just connect your Instacast Cloud account with your Flattr account to enable automatic flattring of podcast episodes.You can choose to flattr once you finish playing an episode, once you mark an episode as favorite or once you mark an episode as played.As soon as one of these events happen, Instacast communicates with Instacast Cloud and will flattr the episode automatically.</p>
