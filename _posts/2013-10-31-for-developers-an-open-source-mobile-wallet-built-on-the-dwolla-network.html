<p>Today, it’s getting a little easier to build mobile wallets/applications for the Dwolla Network with an open source mobile wallet.Nick Schulze who interned at Dwolla a year and a half ago built a native mobile application leveraging our API that supports the following functionality: If you decide to fork this project and release your own flavor of it, you’ll need to apply your own brand to it. As a developer building a new application it’s also important to work and promote best practices with merchants confirming payments in retail environments.For merchants, the Dwolla Kiosk is an incredibly easy way to confirm all payments in a retail location regardless of the application used to make the payment in store.Remember, 100% of payments on the Dwolla network can be easily and instantly confirmed.</p>
