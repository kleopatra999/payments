<p>As a church leader, you know you’re doing the work you’ve been called to do.Your needs are often met through the offerings of your congregation. Those offerings have traditionally come in the forms of cash and checks, but many houses of worship now accept offerings by credit card, too.Church offerings require a high degree of sensitivity.Having your ushers pass large credit card machines is not only impractical, but may also be distasteful to some members of your congregation.</p>
