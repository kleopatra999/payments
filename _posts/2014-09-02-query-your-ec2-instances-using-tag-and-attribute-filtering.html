<p>As an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) user, you probably know just how simple and easy it is to launch EC2 instances   on an as-needed basis.Perhaps you got your start by manually launching an instance or two,   and later moved to a model where you launch instances through a AWS CloudFormation template,    Auto Scaling, or in Spot form.Today we are launching an important new feature for the AWS Management Console.You can now find the instance or instances   that you are looking for by filtering on tags and attributes, with some advanced options including   inverse search, partial search, and regular expressions.Instance Tags 
    Regardless of the manner in which you launch them, you probably want to track the role (development,   test, production, and so forth) internal owner, and other attributes of each instance.</p>
