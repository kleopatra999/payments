<p>At 3scale we recommend using Nginx as an API proxy for several reasons, among them its outstanding performance and its extensibility thanks to the Lua scripting support.When used to integrate with 3scaleâ€™s API Management service, it is hands down the best way to add an access control layer to your existing API.The following tutorial describes the required steps in order to deploy Nginx acting as an API Gateway proxy on the Heroku platform.Heroku provides a fantastic fully managed platform as a service for your application, so the required maintenance effort for your part will be minimal.Thanks to Nginx being very lightweight, the free offering from Heroku will be enough for most cases.</p>
