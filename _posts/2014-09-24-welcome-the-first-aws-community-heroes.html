<p>I love the community that has formed around AWS!Many of our customers have   decided, with no help or encouragement from us, to actively and independently   promote our services, solutions, blog posts, success stories, and best practices   to their peers online.They do this by blogging, tweeting, creating videos, writing and   sharing sample code, authoring books and tutorials, setting up and running   AWS user groups, and so forth.AWS Community Heroes 
   In order to recognize and publicly acknowledge the efforts of these hard-working folks,   we have launched the AWS Community Hero program.An AWS Community Hero has routinely delivered  high-quality, impactful, developer-focused activities to the AWS Community.</p>
