<p>If youre just setting up a small business, it can be confusing figuring out how to process credit card payments, deposit cash and pay your bills.For most businesses, this means opening two distinct types of accounts â€” a merchant account for your credit card transactions and a traditional bank account for your cash sales and to pay the bills.About Merchant Accounts
Merchant accounts are contracts between a retailer and a credit card processing company or a bank.The merchant account acts as an intermediary between the retailer and individual credit card sponsoring banks.Such accounts make it easy for retailers to accept credit and debit card payments, without having to worry about security or fraud.</p>
