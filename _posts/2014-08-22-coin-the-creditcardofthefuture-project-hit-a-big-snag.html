<p>Coin is the much-hyped (and very successful) crowdfunded project that aims to change everything about how you pay for things.You might think of it as one credit card to rule them all â€” it digitally stores multiple credit numbers on one device, which you can swipe as though it were a standard card.But theres still quite a ways to go before the miracle card becomes a casual, everyday, no-big-deal reality, reports The Verge.For now, the device only works at 85% of credit card terminals.Coin was originally supposed to launch by the end of this year.</p>
