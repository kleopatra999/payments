<p>Since JustGiving launched 13 years ago, we’ve been finding new ways to connect causes with people who care.With eight million registered users and a million new this year, JustGiving is now the world’s fastest growing social platform for giving.  
Today we’re opening the door to our platform with the launch of our new global APIs, allowing anyone to build apps that make a difference.Anyone, anywhere can now build apps for good 
Opening up our platform globally is a proud moment for us, because it means that the capacity to develop new apps for good is now virtually unlimited.Anyone with a great idea and development talent, anywhere in the world, can create new apps that make a real difference.</p>
