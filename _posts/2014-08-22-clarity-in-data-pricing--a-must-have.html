<p>The emerging discussion in the communications industry is how we get beyond data.Pricing data per megabyte, for example, does not make sense.Customers (even those who work in the communications industry) cannot tell you how much data a video consumes.Even an engineer would ask you technical questions about quality, jitter and who knows what.Uncertainty and lack of clarity brings only mistrust.</p>
