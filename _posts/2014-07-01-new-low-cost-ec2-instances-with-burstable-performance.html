   Even though the speedometer in my car maxes out at 150 MPH, I rarely   drive at that speed (and the top end may be more optimistic than   realistic), but it is certainly nice to have the option to   do so when the time and the circumstances are right.Most of the   time I am using just a fraction of the power that is available to   me.Many interesting compute workloads follow a similar pattern, with   modest demands for continuous compute power and occasional needs for   a lot more.Examples of this type of workload include remote   desktops, development environments (including build servers), low   traffic web sites, and small databases.</p>
