<p>Security is one of the biggest considerations in everything we do.In addition to two-factor authentication, we now offer an account activity view, where you can see where and when activity on your account is happening.The Last Account Activity link in the footer of your dashboard now shows the locations, IP addresses, and times of recent dashboard activity.(As before, you can also view all API requests in the logs section.) If anything looks suspicious or if you simply forgot to sign out of another browser, you can use the Account Activity dialog to terminate any active sessions.</p>
