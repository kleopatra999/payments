   When you move from a static operating environment to a dynamically   scaled, cloud-powered environment, you need to take a fresh look at   your model for capturing, storing, and analyzing the log files   produced by your operating system and your applications.Because   instances come and go, storing them locally for the long term   is simply not appropriate.When running at scale, simply finding storage space for   new log files and managing expiration of older ones can become a   chore.Further, theres often actionable information buried within   those files.</p>
