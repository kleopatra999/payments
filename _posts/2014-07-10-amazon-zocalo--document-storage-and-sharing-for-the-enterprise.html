   I have been writing this blog for almost ten years!For most of that   time, my workflow for writing and reviewing drafts has revolved   around my email inbox.I write a draft and then hand it off to the   Product Manager for review.The Product Manager, in turn, will hand   the draft off to their team and to other stakeholders and reviewers   within the company.</p>
