<p>I am a fan of the minimalist wallet and I am not alone.Over 500 Kickstarter projects have redesigned the classic bi-fold wallet for all of us who prefer carrying plastic and avoid ATM (cash) machines.PayPal further reduces our paperwork for transactions – and of course, gives us one more excuse to move to those snazzy slim wallets.Today we’re pleased to announce you can now use PayPal to pay for your Twilio usage.In 26 currencies and 203 countries, the PayPal payment option lets you apply your PayPal balance, bank transfers, credit cards, PayPal Credit, and debit cards towards your Twilio usage.</p>
