<p>Today, we are releasing MoSQL, a tool Stripe developed for live-replicating data from a MongoDB database into a PostgreSQL database.With MoSQL, you can run applications against a MongoDB database, but also maintain a live-updated mirror of your data in PostgreSQL, ready for querying with the full power of SQL.Motivation Here at Stripe, we use a number of different database technologies for both internal- and external-facing services.Over time, weve found ourselves with growing amounts of data in MongoDB that we would like to be able to analyze using SQL.MongoDB is great for a lot of reasons, but its hard to beat SQL for easy ad-hoc data aggregation and analysis, especially since virtually every developer or analyst already knows it.</p>
