   My colleagues launched the new   Fire phone last week and the reception   from Amazon customers and the tech industry has been incredible.As a long-time user of an Android-powered   phone I am looking forward to receiving a Fire phone of my very own sometime soon.Although I have yet to build an actual mobile app of my own, I am thrilled by the possibilities offered by   the Fire phone.With features like   Dynamic Perspective,   Firefly technology, and an   advanced camera system   (my iPhone-toting wife is jealous), coupled with a fast, quad-core   processor and exceptional audio, there is plenty of room for innovation and creativity.</p>
