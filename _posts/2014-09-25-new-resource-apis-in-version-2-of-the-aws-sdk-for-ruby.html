<p>We are launching a preview of a new, resource-style API model for the AWS SDK for Ruby.I will summarize the preview here, and refer you to the post  AWS SDK for Ruby 2 Preview Release on the  AWS Ruby Development Blog for full information!If youâ€™ve used Version 1 of the AWS SDK for Ruby, you are likely   already familiar with resource objects available for a number of   services.These resource objects allow you to work with AWS resources   as Ruby objects with attributes that are automatically loaded from   the service and instance methods that map to API   actions that can be taken on the resource.The interface also provides collection classes for easy   iteration.</p>
