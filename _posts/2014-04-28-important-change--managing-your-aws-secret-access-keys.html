Last month I urged you to download your secret access key(s) for your AWS (root) account in advance of a planned change in our access model.We have implemented the change and you can no longer retrieve existing secret access keys for the root account.If you lose your secret access key, you must generate a new access key (an access key ID and a secret access key).</p>
