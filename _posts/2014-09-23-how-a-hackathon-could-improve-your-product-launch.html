Its not uncommon for tech companies to hold hackathons on a regular basis.Many of us have heard of the all-night coding sessions held at Facebook, and tech CEOs are often citing hackathons as the original source of some of their best ideas.But dont just hold a hackathon for the sake of holding one!This summer, we held our first internal hackathon at SecureNetÂ and learned how to use the opportunity to create meaningful value for the company.Although the hackathon was designed to be a contest, every team made important contributions to a product we were getting ready to launch.</p>
