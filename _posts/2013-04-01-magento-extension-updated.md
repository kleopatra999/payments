<p>Our new developer evangelist intern, Gordon, has been hard at work these past couple of weeks.Today, his first big project rolls out: a long-awaited update to the Dwolla Magento eCommerce extension.Our Magento extension was long due for a revamp – and this update definitely delivered it.Along with a whole lot of bug fixes, Gordon has implemented our Guest Checkout functionality, event listeners that carefully listen to transaction status change notifications from Dwolla, and logging features.So now, when your customers use their bank accounts to pay for their order, Magento will automatically update its order status as the Dwolla transaction status changes, while verifying the authenticity of the notifications, and alerting you in the order’s comments area when problems arise.</p>
