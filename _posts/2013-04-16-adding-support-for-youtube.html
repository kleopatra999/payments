<p>Creators are uploading 72 hours of video to YouTube every minute of the day.much of it is what make the internet valuable for us all to use.Now you can easily show real appreciation to all creators on YouTube.Just like on Soundcloud, Vimeo, Instagram etc you just like creators on YouTube to send a microdonation to them.We think this is a big thing.</p>
