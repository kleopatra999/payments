<p>Have you ever used your credit card at a retail store and had the clerk ask for your ZIP code?This happens at the gas station, too.When you pay at the pump, most pumps wont approve the purchase and allow you to fill your tank unless you enter your five-digit ZIP code.Ever wonder why the credit card machine asks for your ZIP code?The credit card machines at gas stations and other automated points of purchase require the ZIP code for security reasons.</p>
