<p>Charmaine Oak, Practice Lead at Digital Money has just published a book - The Digital Money Game.Given her level of experience and knowledge, we asked Charmaine what she thought about the payments market and what services will win – and lose.BV: It seems as if everyone is getting into the payments game – from banks, to Telcos, payments providers, Google, Apple – who knows who else.Which sector do you think has the best chance of winning – or perhaps better put, what does a winner need to provide to customers to win.CO: This is a very interesting question and really is the crux of the book.</p>
