<p>It’s been a busy 100 + days at Spreedly.Around March 1st we switched from emphasizing our subscriptions offering to focusing on Spreedly (Core).In May we successfully raised a seed round via AngelList.In July we announced the sale of our subscriptions business to Pin Payments.There’s one recurring theme at Spreedly we find fascinating.</p>
