<p>When we launched Stripe Shop, a lot of   people asked us to open-source it so they could build their own   single-page stores.Weve just released the code on Github;   please feel free to borrow any parts you find useful!(We didnt want to open-source the photo of Kat and Thairu, so we decided to take a replacement.)</p>
