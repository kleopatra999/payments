From March 17th to 21st, Game Developers Conference is once again taking place at Moscone Center in San Francisco.Visit us at booth 1925 or e-mail us at usbd@fortumo.com to see how we can help you grow your payment volume.During GDC last year, we announced launching mobile payments on Windows Phone and Microsoft’s smartphone platform has grown rapidly over the past year: 
Windows Phone apps now make 8x more revenue per download than Android apps: the 3 billion Windows Phone app downloads are worth 24 billion downloads on Android; 
Meanwhile, it is much easier to stand out on Windows because many of the top Android titles are not yet available on Windows – less apps means a higher likelihood of getting noticed; 
Windows Phone has equal pricing to Android, which is especially important for emerging markets; 
Windows Phone is outselling iOS in 24 markets – most of these are in countries where mobile operating billing is the primary way users pay for apps.Windows Phone has positioned itself to succeed in emerging markets.</p>
