<p>I was looking at doing a rough draft (think POC) for an app and wanted to use WebAPI for the back end.Azure hosting came to mind so I had a play creating a cloud service.Unfortunately my azure bill, mainly from the beeb live tile’s using up bandwidth, is already more than enough.This was when I realised that you can host MVC 4 projects in Azure Websites and the shared instances allow 10 free sites.This means I can quickly setup a simple Web API, that isn’t going to see huge traffic or require gigantic resources, for free and use this to build out the app!</p>
