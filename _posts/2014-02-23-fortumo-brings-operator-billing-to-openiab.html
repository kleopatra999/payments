Today we are once again making payments easier for Android developers.Fortumo has partnered with the One Platform Foundation to add operator billing to the Open In-App Billing (OpenIAB) initiative.We have previously written about how reaching end-users is challenging for Android developers – Google Play is not the only channel for distribution and dozens of alternative app stores are growing in market share, especially in emerging markets.Google Play payments do not work in these alternative channels so while you are getting additional downloads, using the same payment solution does not work.It is also important to note that a growing number of Android devices shipped are not running Google’s version of Android: 30% of Android phones shipped in Q3 2013 had a customized version of Android installed into them.</p>
