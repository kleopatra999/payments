<p>We are often asked whether or not merchants need SSL, given the the fact that Recurly is already PCI compliant. The short answer is Yes. Any website handling credit card information should always use SSL in conjunction with Recurly’s PCI compliant checkout forms to best ensure customer data is encrypted and secure.SSL (Single Secure Layer encryption) is a method for encrypting data as it travels across the internet and ensures that the data remains safe. Using SSL improves credibility of a merchant’s website – savvy online customers look  for “https” instead of “http” in their browser URL when visiting websites.</p>
