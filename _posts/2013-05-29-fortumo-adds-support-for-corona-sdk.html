<p>When developing new products at Fortumo, our goal is to make mobile payments as simple as possible for developers to integrate on all platforms.Today we’ve made our Android SDK compatible with Corona development framework which makes developers lives easier.This means that if you are using the Corona framework for developing apps, you can now add native in-app purchasing functionality in less than an hour using Lua and Corona SDK.Here’s how to do it:
 Sign up at our homepage, create an account and through the Dashboard, create an Android in-app payment service.After your service is successfully created, download the corresponding Android billing library from the Dashboard.</p>
