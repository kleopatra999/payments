<p>Placecast announces the launch of its latest product: an innovation in the mobile space that combines location-based mobile marketing with mobile commerce - the ShopAlerts Mobile Wallet.Built in HTML5, the Wallet works on all smartphone platforms and offers customers a first-ever turnkey solution for launching personalized location-based mobile offers tied to mobile payments.There’s no app to build for marketers, and no app for consumers to download.Unlike other mobile wallet offerings, Placecast will white-label the product specifically to credit card companies, mobile operators and retailers through a robust set of API’s, or through the reskinnable HTML5 Wallet.Check out the video in our next post for a closer look at some of the Wallets’ features and user-experience.</p>
