<p>Use whatever technology you want for your API (SOAP, REST, webDAV or others) without the need to apply latest web technologies or to the need to build knowledge internally.Elastic.io takes care of reading different data formats, translating and transforming them into target formats by giving you the tools to graphically map the meta data structure once and for all.Furthermore elastic.io gives you the control to monitor what is happening with your API and ensures that no record will be lost which includes the queuing and temporary storage.</p>
