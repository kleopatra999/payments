   The AWS Console mobile app   for iOS and Android gives you quick, easy access to   your AWS resources.You can see and manage your existing EC2   instances, S3 buckets, load balancers, database instances,   Auto Scaling groups, OpsWorks stacks, and CloudWatch alarms.We added support for   Amazon S3   in the last release but I was super busy and didnt have time to blog about it.</p>
