<p>Chicagos Lollapalooza Music Festival is launching a new cashless system, allowing attendees to buy food and drink with a personal RFID bracelet distributed on entrance.To pay a vendor, concertgoers will simply tap their bracelet against a vendors point-of-sale system, wirelessly transmitting their credit card information.The system requires users to opt-in in advance, so no one will be forced to load their credit cards onto the bracelet, but organizers estimate even Â partial adoption could speed up often chaotic food and drink lines.Bonnaroo and Coachella both use RFID bracelets as ticket substitutes, but neither has taken the leap to a full RFID-enabled payment system.For large festivals, the bracelets can also be used to create a record of which acts a given concertgoer has seen, potentially creating a valuable source of data for bands and organizers who want to send follow-up emails, distribute live sets, or gauge attendance.</p>
