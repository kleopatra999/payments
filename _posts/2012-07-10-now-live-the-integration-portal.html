<p>First things first, if youâ€™re a developer, I highly suggest you check out this dev blog post on http://dev.dwolla.com/.This post is meant to be more of an introduction of sorts for all of our non-technical business development, product and design friends looking to learn if a Dwolla integration is right for their company, app or project.One of the most beautiful and powerful things about Dwolla is its web-driven and open structure, or its ability to play nicely with a host of other Internet technologies.</p>
