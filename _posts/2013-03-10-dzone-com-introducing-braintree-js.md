<p>When youre processing credit card payments, PCI compliance can be a drag.Even if youre not storing credit card data in your system (which you shouldnt), youll still be subject to a large amount of PCI scope if raw credit card data passes through your system at all.This can mean audits, fees and other undesireable things.In the past, Braintree provided Transparent Redirect (TR) to our merchants as a tool to greatly reduce PCI scope.With TR, credit card data is passed directly to Braintrees servers, meaning no credit card data passes through merchants servers at all.</p>
