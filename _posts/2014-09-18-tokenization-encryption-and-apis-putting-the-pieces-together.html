<p>One of the most effective ways to prevent security breaches in the payments process is tokenizing credit card information in the pre-authorization stage.Tokenization is the process of substituting sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, with a non-sensitive equivalent, called a token, which has no exploitable meaning or value.The new string of characters that comprise the token is unreadable to the untrained eye, making it meaningless to someone if they were to steal the information.Tokenization therefore brings an added security measure and reduces vulnerability.Encryption, often utilized with tokenization, is a common added security practice that involves the process of using an algorithm to morph data in transit into a format readable only with a secured key.</p>
