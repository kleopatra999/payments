<p>From direct deposit payroll to B2B transactions, Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments have become the preferred standard for companies and employees around the globe.Throughout its 40-year history, users have continued to embrace ACH payments for their convenience, speed and reliability.ACH payments are also more environmentally friendly than traditional paper-based checks.Because payments happen through electronic transfers across the ACH network, neither senders nor recipients are required to invest in materials such as paper, ink or postage (although its worth noting that standard checks can be digitized and converted into an ACH payment).As an added benefit, the ACH network permits recurring billing â€” freeing businesses from sending out invoices month after month.</p>
