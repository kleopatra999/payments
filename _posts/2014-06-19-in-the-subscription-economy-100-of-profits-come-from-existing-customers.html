<p>For the vast majority of recurring revenue businesses, existing customers don’t just fuel growth—they represent all of the businesses’ profits.Take the average customer relationship in the SaaS market: it takes 3.14 years to reach profitability, which for a $12,000/year subscription would mean $37,680 to hit breakeven.That means a full 68 percent of the revenue needed to achieve profitability is collected after the initial contract.This means profitability stems first from ensuring customer success and then growing the relationship.</p>
