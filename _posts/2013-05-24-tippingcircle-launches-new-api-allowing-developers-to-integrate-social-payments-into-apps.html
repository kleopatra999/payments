 TippingCircle makes it possible for users to make person-to-person payments, group payments and set up social fundraising via PayPal and social networks including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+.Users of the TippingCircle platform are able to create their own social payments profile which makes it easy to send and receive payments and helps create a fun and interactive payment experience.TippingCircle Founder James Davis, is quoted in the press release as saying: 


 The new TippingCircle API is a hybrid API that uses both OAuth and simple authentication based on the endpoint.API endpoints include sign up, get user, get buckets, and get transactions.</p>
