<p>As reported in the news this week, a major bug nick-named heartbleed was reported in OpenSSL, the open source cryptographic library used by websites around the world to protect users information being transmitted over the internet.The heartbleed bug impacted an estimated 2/3rds of all websites so we had to react quickly to ensure your data stayed safe.What are we doing?On Monday April 7th, within two hours of the heartbleed bug report, we had patched all of our infrastructure which holds your private information.Within 24 hours, all of our remaining public services, such as our marketing site, status site, and blog â€“ none of which contain customer information, were patched as well.</p>
