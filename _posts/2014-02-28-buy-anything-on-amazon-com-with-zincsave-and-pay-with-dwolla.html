<p>As a Dwolla member, we know that a lot of you have a balance in your account but have nowhere to use Dwolla locally.That can be kind of frustrating if you’re a consumer.If you’re a small business, we know you may be receiving large payments with Dwolla, as well as ordering supplies to run your day-to-day.Paper, ink, pens, paper…anything.In Des Moines, we’re lucky to have a local office supply store named Koch Brothers just drop off whatever we need.</p>
