<p>Dwolla Direct is a simple and secure way for individuals and organizations to send money using the Dwolla network-without registering for a free full Dwolla account.By allowing users to access and send money from their existing bank and credit union accounts, Dwolla is lowering the barrier of entry into the network and helping digitize paper checks.By creating a Direct account during the first-time payment flow, senders securely wrap their payment information with a username and password and hide bank account and routing numbers from the recipient.Upon return, senders can access and send money directly from their linked bank or credit account by simply entering their Direct credentials.To create a Dwolla Direct account, simply provide Dwolla an email address and a password.</p>
