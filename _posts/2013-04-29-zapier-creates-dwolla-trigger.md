<p>One thing we do not have a shortage of in 2013 is web apps.Chances are, you or your business have active accounts in services like Gmail, Freshbooks, Basecamp, MailChimp, GitHub, Evernote, Facebook, Twitter, and much more. Wouldn’t it be nice if these apps talked to each other so that all your data was up-to-date across all of your accounts?Zapier is a web app automation service that helps you or your small business keep all of your services up-to-date through simple integrations, without having to shell out thousands of dollars on developer costs. Save hours of updating, copying and pasting by simply setting up an automated ‘Zap,’ or trigger, that will complete the task for you.</p>
