   I am happy to be able to announce that AWS has achieved the first   DoD Provisional Authorization under the DoD Cloud Security Models   at security impact levels 3-5!AWS previously received a DoD   Provisional Authorization for security impact levels 1-2.This new   Authorization covers AWS GovCloud (US) and DoD customers can now   move forward with their deployments of applications processing   controlled and for official use only unclassified information.As   part of the Level 3-5 Authorization, our partners and DoD customers   will be able to implement a wide range of DoD requirements necessary   to protect their data at these levels, including AWS Direct Connect   routing to the DoDs network, comprehensive computer network defense   coverage, and   Common Access Card (CAC) integration.</p>
