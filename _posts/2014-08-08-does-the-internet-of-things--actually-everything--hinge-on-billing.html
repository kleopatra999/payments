<p>There seem to be an almost equal number of new opportunities for communications providers as threats.On the one hand we hear that the ‘bread and butter’ revenues of telecoms companies – voice and SMS – are being eroded by OTT players.One of the other hand we see a host of new revenue opportunities – from Direct Operator Billing to partnerships with OTT players, a new range of MVNOs and other wholesale players; as well as the whole ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT).At the same time, we love being cynical (shurely not, Ed) about the entrenched, siloed and ‘telco head’ thinking that stills exists in the majority of telcos.With everything going virtual, can the backend cope we ask.</p>
