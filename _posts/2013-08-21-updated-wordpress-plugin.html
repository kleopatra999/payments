<p>We all know that WordPress powers a large portion of the web, and an even larger portion of all blogs.But, judging by the amount of support requests we’ve been getting recently, I could swear WordPress’s marketshare grew to about 99%.While we’ve had a WordPress plugin out for a while now, it only supported the “old” payment buttons (read: simple, fixed amount, boring buttons).After recently updating and releasing an array of new features and styles, I thought it would be time we updated our WordPress plugin as well.So today, I’m happy to present v4.</p>
