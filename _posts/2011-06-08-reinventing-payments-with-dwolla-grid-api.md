{% include JB/setup %}<p>The Dwolla payment service just launched a new payment API called Grid.Before you can understand grid, you need to understand Dwollasphilosophyon payments.Every time you want to do seemingly simple things, like buy a coffee, pay for lunch, or buy gas, current providers are requiring you hand over your name, credit card number, and expiration date, leaving trail of personal and financial data behind you.With an opportunity to start fresh, Dwolla wanted to change this, and thats what they are doing with Grid.Grid provides third party developers tools to create a seamless in-app purchasing experience with no more credit card numbers.</p>
