   We have received a lot of great feedback on the   partner webinars   that we held in April.In conjunction with our partners,   we will be holding two more webinars this month.The webinars   are free, but space is limited and preregistration is    advisable.In May we are turning our focus to the all-important topic of   security, and what it means in the cloud.</p>
