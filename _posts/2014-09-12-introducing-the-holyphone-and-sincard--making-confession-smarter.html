<p>Very few press releases get read twice here on BillingViews Boulevard.In fact, it would be true to say that most are scanned with a finger hovering, dagger like, over the ‘delete’ key.Imagine the scene, when this popped into the mailbox:
 ‘The Vatican introduces a high tech approach to confession, placing smartphones in confessionals which connect to the Vatican Confessional Call Centre where priests hear confessions and accept monetary contributions to the church, paid by credit card, PayPal and even SinCards.This is a huge success in Europe and North America.’
 Frankly, on the second reading it was even more fascinating.</p>
