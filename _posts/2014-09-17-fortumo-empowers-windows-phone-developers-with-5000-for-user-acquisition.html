<p>Great news for Windows Phone developers!After helping more than 300 developers get started in the Windows ecosystem we have decided to launch a new developer program to help you boost your in-app purchasing revenue and help you get more users for your apps.Carrier billing on Windows Phone has proven to bring a significant uplift in transactions and revenue since Windows Phone has primarily the biggest footprint in emerging markets like Central & Eastern Europe and Asia where credit card penetration is sometimes below 15%.Carrier billing with Fortumo is designed to complement Microsoftâ€™s own payment solution.For Windows Phone Store, Fortumo provides mobile payments in 81 countries and over 300 mobile networks.</p>
