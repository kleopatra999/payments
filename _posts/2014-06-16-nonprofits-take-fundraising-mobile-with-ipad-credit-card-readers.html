<p>Charitable giving is how most nonprofits raise funds.But traditional methods for collecting money have severe limitations:
Cash collections require that donors have money on hand (78 percent of Americans carry less than $50 at any given time).Checks can bounce, resulting in fees for both the giver and receiver.Â  Moreover, it can take as many as five business days for a good check to clear.Some savvier nonprofits accept credit cards using terminals or online payment gateways.</p>
