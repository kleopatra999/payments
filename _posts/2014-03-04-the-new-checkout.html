<p>We launched the first version of the Checkout a year ago.From the start, the goal has been to create best possible payments flow.Each site should not have to duplicate the work of device optimization and A/B testing.When you use Checkout, you have a team of Stripe engineers and designers continually optimizing your payment interface.Today, weâ€™ve released a new version of Checkout.</p>
