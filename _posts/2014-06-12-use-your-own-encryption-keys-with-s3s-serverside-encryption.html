   Amazon S3 stores trillions of objects and processes more than a million   requests per second for them.As the number of use cases for S3 has grown, so have the requests for additional ways to protect data in motion   (as it travels to and from S3) and at rest (while it is stored).The first requirement is met by the use of   SSL, which has been supported by S3 from the very beginning.There are several options for the protection   of data at rest.</p>
