<p>Payments startup Balanced is looking for ways in which its marketplace customers can more quickly exchange funds between those who are purchasing goods or services on their platforms to those who provide them.The latest option to be added is a feature that will enable marketplaces to instantly place money into users’ checking accounts by pushing payment to their debit cards.More than just a payments processor, Balanced is focused on helping clients with two-sided marketplace businesses that bring money in from users and pay money out to service providers or goods sellers.Thanks to the growing number of sharing-economy businesses out there — which connect people who have unused goods or time on their hands with those who are looking to make some extra money from unused assets or skills — it’s been a pretty good business.“Marketplaces as a category are growing faster than any other e-commerce companies,” said co-founder and CEO Matin Tamizi.</p>
