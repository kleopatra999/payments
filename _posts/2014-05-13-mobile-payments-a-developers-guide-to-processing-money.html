<p>Mobile Payments: A Developers Guide to Processing Money|Fortumo Mobile Payments Blog
                          Mattias Liivak                          Head of PR & Marketing                                                                    
This week the Application Developers Alliance put out a white paper on the topic of mobile payments which Fortumo was happy to contribute to.If you’re not yet using mobile payments for your apps, this paper is a great source to start from as it gives a high-level overview of the added benefits (and revenue) that implementing additional payment solutions can bring. For example, the paper notes that app stores which use carrier billing solutions have seen a 5-6x increase in conversion rates compared with credit-card billing.Sounds interesting?</p>
