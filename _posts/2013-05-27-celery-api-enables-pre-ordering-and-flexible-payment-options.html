<p>Celery, flexible ecommerce solution provider, allows users to accept pre-orders without charging the customer until the product is ready to ship.On the flip side, customers also have the capability to pre-pay for goods and services.In addition to flexible payment options, Celery allows developers to integrate its functionality with third party apps and workflows via the Celery API.Airbrite (Celery’s parent company) co-founder, Chris Tsai, commented: Celery launched in private beta a couple of months ago, but has already enjoyed hundreds of adopters.Early partners include 3Doodler, Dagne Dover,  Breathometer, and more.</p>
