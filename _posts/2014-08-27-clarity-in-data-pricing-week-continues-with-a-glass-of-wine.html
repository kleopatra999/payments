<p>It seems to be ‘data pricing’ week at BillingViews Boulevard.And why not?Almost every day another example of plans that make no sense comes to light.So why should we not complain, compare and if necessary satirise the incomprehensible notion that customers are going know what 2 Gigabytes actually buys them.Take wine.</p>
