<p>If you use Stripe and Zendesk, you may ask yourself questions about how customer support contributes to revenue, or want to segment your help tickets by payment information.Usually this data sits in two different places but with DataHero’s Combines, you can merge data from these two services for business insights.Segment help questions by customer plan, or other payment characteristics.Then ask questions like: “which customers are more likely to upgrade”, or “how can I better address the questions from my most valuable customers”?Which of my customers are filing the most tickets?</p>
