<p>Ed Cervantes-Watson is a man who knows about APIs.Here he explains how Cancer Research UK has used the JustGiving APIs to power some of their apps and products, and shares his tips on how your charity can do just the same.When I joined Cancer Research UK’s innovation team an API (Application Programming Interface as it’s less commonly known!) sounded rather like a diagnosis I didn’t want my doctor to give me.Eighteen months on (and much to my doctor’s satisfaction) I cannot imagine launching a digital fundraising product that does not in some way rely on these little marvels.</p>
