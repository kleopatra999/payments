<p>Peer-to-peer fundraising is on the rise and we here at Minds On Design Lab are excited by that.Like a recipe for a favorite meal these campaigns combine design, technology and your community to create impactful online engagement.So how can we make it better?A common mistake is to put all efforts on the larger campaign and forgot that your supporters will be responsible for running their own personal mini-campaigns.Something they might not be very familiar with unless they happen to be a fundraiser themselves.</p>
