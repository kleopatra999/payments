You dont need to worry about procuring a server, installing and configuring an operating system, or installing the actual software that you set out to use in the first place.AWS Marketplace is a short, direct path that will have you up and running in minutes.Because you can launch fully installed and configured software in minutes, you can easily try out one or more products until you find the one that is the best match for your requirements.</p>
