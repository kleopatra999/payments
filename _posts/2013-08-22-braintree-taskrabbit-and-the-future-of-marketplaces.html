<p>Marketplaces are all the rage, fueled in part by a boom in collaborative consumption business models.Interest in them has only accelerated since we wrote a post around marketplaces and payments back in November 2012.For a multitude of reasons the default payment assumption when approaching a marketplace is “I need to collect money from the buyers on my site, keep some sort of fee for myself, and then disburse or payout the rest to the seller.” Sounds easy but turns out to be very hard.Collecting and disbursing money gives you a lot of control as a marketplace.</p>
