<p>It seems ACH is too slow even for some bankers.Payments in the US lag behind much of the world and many Americans inside and outside of the financial services community would like to move their money more quickly.The Federal Reserve agrees, and convened a roundtable that determined the only way to make payments faster would be to develop a completely new system.In a roundtable discussion convened on June 3 and 4, 50 participants broadly agreed that the way to faster payments is to ditch the antiquated CH infrastructure and start over fresh.Easier said than done.</p>
