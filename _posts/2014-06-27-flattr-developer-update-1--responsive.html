<p>In the process of creating a new Flattr experience responsive design is obviously core.Time to show the first iteration of the design and UX for what is to come.  
Simplicity and usability will the main focus in this update.The mobile web demands the removal of clutter.That is a good thing as it forces us to make the hard choices.</p>
