<p>PayAnywhere is happy to be adding two software developer kits (SDKs) to our developer library.Previously only available for iOS, the new basic and advanced SDKs provides Android developers with the ability to embed credit card processing functionality into any application.The idea behind our SDKs is to allow apps of all types to process Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express credit cards while increasing customer and merchant account satisfaction.Along with credit card processing, SDKs gives Android developers access to several important and necessary features that PayAnywhere’s mobile credit card processing software comes with. Merchant accounts are able to obtain signatures through the new software, attach invoice numbers to transactions, print or send receipts to customers via email, keep a record of transactions, view detailed transaction reports, and much more.</p>
