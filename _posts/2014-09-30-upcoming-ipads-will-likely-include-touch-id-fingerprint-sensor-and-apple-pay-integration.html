<p>Apple is rumored to update its iPad lineup soon, and some additional details have emerged about the tablets features.Apple is expected to introduce new models of both the iPad Air and the iPad Mini during an October event, and it looks like both tablets will include a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, just like the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6.Whats more, Apple appears to be planning on including some level of Apple Pay integration for iPads, according to a line of code found within the newest beta release of Apples iOS 8.1 operating system (via MacRumors).Now, this doesnt exactly mean that youll soon be waving your iPad at a cash register to pay, but Apple is likely going to at least allow people to make in-app purchases using the Touch ID fingerprint and Apple Pay, which would speed up the process of inputting payment information.</p>
